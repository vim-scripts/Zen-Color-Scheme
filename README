Zen is a color scheme for white background terminals with elegant and clean look and feel. This color scheme was developed on Mac OS X but it also looks great on Ubuntu Linux.

NOTE: this color scheme is now for me deprecated, I would recommend to install Satori color scheme http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1614
